## ðŸ“šDescription:<a name="description"></a>
Nonchalant Simian Watercraft Association is my solution to the Alphapoint coding challenge. It solves the problem of making Ethereum gas fee data more accessible. It does this through wrapping endpoints to ethgasstation.info and adding additional functionality with historical averages in specific time frames.
	
## ðŸ”®Decisions:<a name="decisions"></a>
I created a REST API because it felt more practical. Although ethereum gas fees are constantly changing, accessing them at a specific point in time is still useful. Additionally, the main added functionality is to access gas averages over time which would not benefit from websockets.
I decided to host with Deta and use Deta Base because it is very convenient. It was easy for me to set up and get working and provides a very simple way for people to host the project with no code required.
